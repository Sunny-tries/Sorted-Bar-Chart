# Sorted-Bar-Chart

This C++ application prompts the user to input six non-negative integers and six characters, then uses this data to generate two bar charts. The first chart is unsorted, displaying the bars in the order they were entered, while the second chart shows the bars sorted by height in ascending order. Each bar's height is determined by the integers entered, and the bars are labeled with the corresponding characters provided by the user.
