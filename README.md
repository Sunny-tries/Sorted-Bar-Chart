# Sorted-Bar-Chart

This C++ application prompts the user to input six non-negative integers and six characters, then uses this data to generate two bar charts. The first chart is unsorted, displaying the bars in the order they were entered, while the second chart shows the bars sorted by height in ascending order. Each bar's height is determined by the integers entered, and the bars are labeled with the corresponding characters provided by the user.

- This C++ program collects six non-negative integers and six characters from the user, then displays two bar charts: one unsorted and one sorted by height. It first ensures all numeric inputs are valid, then uses these numbers and characters to create the charts. The getMax function determines the tallest bar for chart height, and the printChart function visually represents each bar with its corresponding character label. The bars are sorted in ascending order using a selection sort algorithm, allowing for a visual comparison between the unsorted and sorted charts.
